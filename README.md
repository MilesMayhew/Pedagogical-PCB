## Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop hardware to facilitate a new learning environment for use in ECE3430 (Introduction to Embedded Computer Systems). The board will support the use of two widely used development boards, the STM32 development board and the TI MSPM0 development board, and contain a number of auxiliary I/O that can be used to develop learning activities to learn how to interface to digital I/O, analog I/O, and serial I/O. This includes a complete hardware design and software solutions for specific implementations of learning activities using specific I/O 
## Usage
- **STM32**
  - For each of the provided software solutions: Open STM32CubeIDE and imp# Bill of Materials (BOM)
